/**
 * Issue #859: Removal listener not called (due to no activity and pending work in write buffer)
 * <p>
 * While a maintenance cycle is running it disables scheduling of a clean up by concurrent writers.
 * When complete the drain status is restored to required and previously this may have had to wait
 * for other activity to trigger the clean up. That could be an excessive delay if the write buffer
 * contains inserted entries, they expire, and a prompt removal notification is expected due to a
 * configured scheduler. To avoid this delay, the maintenance cycle should be scheduled.
